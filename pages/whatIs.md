# BiG-SCAPE

BiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine) is a Python script that calculates a distance matrix between groups of genes. In particular, BiG-SCAPE has been built with the aim of analyzing Biosynthetic Gene Clusters, which encode the pathways for Secondary Metabolites.  

BiG-SCAPE works by predicting and comparing conserved domains found in the proteins encoded in the gene clusters.  

This comparison allows to form a distance matrix that can be used to group similar BGCs automatically.

# CORASON  
CORe Analysis of Syntenic Orthologs to prioritize Natural Product-Biosynthetic Gene Cluster  
CORASON is a visual tool that searches for gene clusters similar to a given one, if these clusters have a genomic core, CORASON sorts them phylogenetically according to it. CORASON outputs are newick trees, a core functional report and SVG files, which among being scalable graphics, also allows to display metadata such as gene function and genome coordinates facilitating genomic analysis.
