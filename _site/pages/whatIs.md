# BiG-SCAPE  
BiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine) is a software package, written in Python, to construct sequence similarity networks of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and group them into gene cluster families (GCFs).  
  
BiG-SCAPE does this by rapidly calculating a distance matrix between gene clusters based on a comparison of their protein domain content, order, copy number, and sequence identity. Outputs of BiG-SCAPE are raw network files as well as a rich graphical user interface in HTML format that can be used to explore the networks and families in your browser.

# CORASON  
CORASON (CORe Analysis of Syntenic Orthologs to prioritize Natural Product Biosynthetic Gene Clusters) is a visual tool that identifies gene clusters that share a common genomic core, and reconstructs multi-locus phylogenies of these gene clusters to explore their evolutionary relationships. CORASON outputs are newick trees, a core functional report and a graphical output in SVG format, which allows to displaying metadata such as gene function and genome coordinates, thus facilitating genomic analysis.
